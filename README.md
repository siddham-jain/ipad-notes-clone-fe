# AI-Powered Math Scanner Web App

## Overview
An advanced mathematical expression scanner and solver API inspired by Apple's new iPadOS feature that can scan and solve mathematical problems from handwritten notes. This project uses Google's Gemini AI model to analyze images containing mathematical content and provide detailed solutions.

This project is inspired by Apple's innovative mathematical expression scanning feature introduced in iPadOS, which allows users to scan and solve mathematical problems directly from handwritten notes. Our implementation extends this concept by providing a robust API that can be integrated into various applications and platforms.

## üåü Features
- **Mathematical Expression Recognition**: Scans and solves various types of mathematical content from images:
  - Simple arithmetic expressions (e.g., 2 + 3 * 4)
  - Complex equations (e.g., x¬≤ + 2x + 1 = 0)
  - Variable assignments (e.g., x = 4, y = 5)
  - Graphical math problems (geometry, trigonometry)
  - Abstract mathematical concepts through drawings

- **BEMDAS Compliance**: Follows standard mathematical order of operations:
  - **B**rackets
  - **E**xponents
  - **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
  - **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

- **Image Processing**: Processes various image formats containing mathematical content


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- Requires clear image quality for accurate recognition
- Complex mathematical notations might need specific formatting
- Processing time may vary based on image complexity
- Dependent on Gemini AI API availability
